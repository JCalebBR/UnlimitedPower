# Unlimited Power
## Description
This is a simple mod that plays various Palpatine related SFX when certain game actions happen. It's a bit of a meme mod, but I hope you enjoy it nonetheless.

## Features
### Audio
* Plays "Unlimited power" on Blitz Smite charge
* On force sword special activation, plays "It's treason then"
* When peril has reached 100 and you have your hands up, plays "No, no, no!"
* When peril has reached 100 and you blow up, plays "The attempt on my life..."

### UI
Mod options are available to set the volume, frequency of the audio and more.

## Limitations
* You need Show Developer Console set to ON and Developer Mode set to ON in DMF settings as per screenshot below, otherwise you'll get a popup cmd window every time the audio file plays. Thanks to **raretrick** for reporting the issue and **SeventeenV** for the graphic.
* This is a limitation from Darktide Local Server, nothing I can do about it for now.

Thanks to DMF, DML and DLS devs for making this possible.
Thanks to my ADHD for making me do this.
I do not own the sound files used in this mod, they are from the Star Wars franchise.
